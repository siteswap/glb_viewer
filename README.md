Run this command in the project root directory, then select which page you want:
	python -m http.server

TIP: Keep each file small and modular, so that Claude/GPTo1 can keep writing all the code!


TODO:
	1) Move physicsController to it's own file/module (reduces context for Claude/GPT)
	2) With this as new base, create a game with fixed loading of town4new and mobius (deco the loading feature)
		

IDEAS:
	Add smart-trainer controls:
		- Bluetooth zwifthub for speed
		- Gyroscope for steering (also buttons incase that doesn't work well)

	Collect the loops to win in record time!
	Shoot the loops if you charge up by peddaling hard.
