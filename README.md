Run this command in the project root directory, then select which page you want:
	python -m http.server

TIP: Keep each file small and modular, so that Claude/GPTo1 can keep writing all the code!
TIP: A common guideline is to aim for modules under 300â€“500 lines of code
	NOTE: - This is where Claude/GPT performance starts to falls off, so it's a great rule to stick with!!!


TODO:
	1) Tidy the code
	2) Powerups & monsters (standard FPV shooter stuff)
		- Start with no gun, have to find it






	---------------------------
	1) Move the white console out of the way (top left for score & power)
	Productionize & monetize asap
		- Stripe (ad-free, $1 / month)
		- Ad-sense 
	1) Question - distance check efficiency? Ask GPT.
	---- Phase - progression ----
	1) MONSTERS that follow you
	1) Re-spawn rings if all found
	1) Different weapon modules (that get dropped after X many rings found):
		Longer range
		Double blaster
		Huge radius blaster
	---- Phase IV  ----
	1) Host a central server with websocket/json updates 
	2) Multi-player: access from desktop & ipad at same time.
		- Be a second rider
		- Be the 'gunner' for the first rider
	3) LAN host option for performance 


All the common FPV features:
	Weapons pick ups
	Monsters chase / shoot

	Buy improvements / customisations
	Level progression - need blender progress 
	Big boss
	Online multiplayer arena
