Whichever file you want to view, name it index.html (it doesnt work otherwise, dont know why).

Host the index.html file with the following command running in the same directory as index.html:
	python -m http.server

IDEAS:
	Split the file up so Claude can continue to handle it.
	Add smart-trainer controls 
	Host a choice of glb models
	Follow the variable road height (how?)
	Dont allow passing through walls (cannon.js collision physics?)
	Simple monster shooting? (Is this available somewhere already?)
